# ActivisionBusinessModelling

Research the activities of a small/medium organisation/company with which you
are familiar with either internally (as a worker) or externally (as a customer/user).
It could be your family business, an organisation in which you worked, or your
experiences of being a regular customer/user in somewhere familiar like a bank
or a shop

Put together a report/case study that covers the following:
1. Background of the organisation (including how you sourced this
information): max 250 words 
2. General description of the main process that you are focusing on e.g.,
billing, ordering, stock: max 250 words 
3. Using your selected case study, create a context diagram to reflect your
scenario. 
4. Using your selected case study, create a Functional Flow and a Cross
functional flow diagram (to include swim lanes) of your selected business
process(es). Make sure to include at least one business sub-process in
your cross-functional flow diagram. 
5. Map out one of your sub-processes using a flow chart.
